  # In the event that Loan#index is displayed, the associated loans would have to be destroyed, or
  # these lost objects would have to be accounted for in the views.
  # In a real-life scenario I would not delete the objects in the database but rather
  # set a deleted_at column and use a delete flag in the callbacks.
